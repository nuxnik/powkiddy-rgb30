# Synopsis

I bought a Powkiddy RGB30 mainly for [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) game development and as a dedicated pico-8 gaming device. The RGB30 doesn't come with a case, so I decided to model one. Before starting, a solid model is useful to work with - keeping the model in scope. I figured the community would find this model useful. Use it for your own custom case mods, holders, wall mounts, etc. When my case if finished, I will be posting it on my profile, so make sure to follow me for updates.

I modeled this project using [Solvespace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl).
